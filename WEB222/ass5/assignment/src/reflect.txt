- HTML forms can be used in response, post comment, online payment, login form, registration, etc. The form can contain a lot of HTML elements that the user can use to enter information. For example: If a user wants to buy some items online, they have to fill in the form with information such as the shipping address and credit/debit card details to ship the item to that address.
- Validation user's input helps us has the correct detail that we need from the user. Also known as data validation, is the proper verification of any input provided by a user or application. Input authentication prevents improperly formatted data from entering the information system. As I learned in the DCF255 course, we can type the HTML code at the input box, it also affects the code of the website when we submit.
- I check all my forms by https://formspree.io/ before uploading it to https://httpbin.org/post. Also, I check the result after submit. During the time I code the form, I just have a hard time with CSS. I have to change my code and research many sites to figure out my problem. I also have to try to code on W3School to avoid effect on my code. It's really hard to have a friendly interface with the user.
- My advice is to build each separate form and test it before combine it and submit. Moreover, we should check the result after submit carefully. Through the final assessment, I learned how to use the input, form and input type. I like the input type because validation of the input always makes me a headache when I learn OOP. In HTML, everything is faster and easier when validating the input. Maybe in the future, I will practice and learn more about HTML, JS because it is really interesting.
