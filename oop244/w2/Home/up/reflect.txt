Through this workshop, I know how to use dynamic memory for an array.  Moreover, I know that we can use the same name for many functions at least it has different types of paraments. The great thing that I can found is creating a dynamic array of characters through the static array of characters. The problem of a dynamic array of characters that we must delete it after use. Using the bool function is a great idea for a function that will return yes or no. Before, I use the int function that will return 1 for yes and 0 for no. But now I think bool is better than the old one I used. The unwrap function is a function that will delete the dynamic memory that was created. However, I think if we use this program in a "switch-case", at the exit of the program, I also insert the code that will delete the dynamic memory too. Before I usually create the const with #define, after this workshop, I know it is better if we create the const by "const type variable".
