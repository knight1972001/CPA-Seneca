C++ was designed with a bias toward system programming and 
embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, 
with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its 
design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many 
other contexts, with key strengths being software 
infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, 
including desktop applications, servers (e.g. e-commerce, 
Web search, or SQL servers), and performance-critical 
applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).

C++ is standardized by the International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version 
ratified and published by ISO in December 2017 as 
ISO/IEC 14882:2017 (informally known as C++17). The C++ 
programming language was initially standardized in 1998 
as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by the 
C++03, C++11 and C++14 standards.
